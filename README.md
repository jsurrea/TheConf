# TheConf

Welcome! This repo is part of my learning adventure on frontend technologies. It was developed mobile-first using Bootstrap 5.3 and includes several key features of the framework such as:

- Scrollspy
- Modals
- Tooltips
- Alerts
- Cards
- Navbars
- Forms
- and more!

Feel free to use this repo as a template for similar projects, or contribute with more amazing features of this framework. I'm always open to contributions ðŸ˜Š

TheConf Hawaii 2023 is here!
